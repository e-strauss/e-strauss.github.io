I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at TU Berlin, with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Data 
Management—especially in the intersection of both fields.

I currently work as a student research assistant at the [DAMS Lab](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dams) (Data Management for Data Science), supervised by 
[Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/). There, I'm involved in the development of [SystemDS](https://systemds.apache.org/), an open-source ML system that supports the entire data science lifecycle—from data integration and cleaning to feature engineering, model training (both local and distributed), and deployment. I'm also a PMC member of the project.

For my Master's thesis, I'm working at the [DEEM Lab](https://deem.berlin/)  (Data Engineering for ML) under the supervision of [Sebastian Schelter](https://deem.berlin/#professor) and [Arnab Phani](https://phaniarnab.github.io), focusing on Responsible Data Engineering.
